Mathew Hastings already has an algorithm for weight reduction. Can we use Mathew Hastings' algorithm for our purpose?

The most important procedure in M. Hastings's algorithm is decongestion lemma (See the second paragraph of page 17 of the arxiv version of the paper [https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=hyatxQ4AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=hyatxQ4AAAAJ:d1gkVwhDpl0C], or see the original paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02249]). (Intrestingly, congestion lemma seemed to arise from network science, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/2984703 )
